# Evolutionary Computation #
This is a project aimed at comparing **evolutionary algorithms**. The benchmark is sonic the hedgehog game. 

This project : 
- Compares three existing evolutionary methods : Genetic Algorithms (GA), CMAES and NEAT.
- Studies the parameters of these methods
- Tests new modifications to the genetic algorithm such as a new crossover and mutation methods

**N.B.** In this project, GA and CMAES are coded in Julia Language, NEAT is coded in Python.
